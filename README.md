Projects:

 - Laser Chess - a 2D java game I am working on.  Eventually it will be two players.  the board is a big 2D squanre.  The players take turns, and on their turn they may either shoot a laser (by giving an angle from 0 to 360 degrees) at their opponent, or moving as a knight moves in chess, two up, one over, etc.  The shots bounce off the reflective walls, so be careful, some angles will return and hit yourself!  Eventually I want to add sound, and then also add obstacles on the board, limiting the shots and movement somewhat.
 
 RouteEvaluator - a java program which solves an emplyment question project I was once given.  Here is the problem:
 
 The world's least efficient automobile, which gets exactly one mpg, will be placed with an empty gas tank at one of n filling stations on a closed loop track.  Each of the n stations has a limited supply of gas; the total from all the stations is the same number (in gallons) as the length of the track(in miles).  Thus the total supply of gasoline is exactly the amount the car requires to complete a loop of the track and return to its origin.

How might you write an alogithm to determine all of the stations at which the car can begin its journey and complete the loop back to its starting point?
